# Graphic method for solving linear programming problems
## Why?
A few years ago I made the project on the same topic (you can find it in directory 'old_sources'). But I hadn't enough skills to do all I wanted, so I am rewriting it with new knowledge and new technologies.

## Functionality
1. Solve linear programming problem with two positive variables (usually economic optimization task).
2. View & save (as image) solution report.
3. View, add, edit & delete problem situations from local database.
4. Search tasks in local DB.

## Roadmap
1. Remove useless functionality (this was an educational project & I needed to meet some requirements).
2. Add LaTeX support (because formulas aren't pretty now).

## Install & run from sourse
Python &ge; 3.6 is required to run this.
After cloning this repo you should install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And run the main script:
```
python main.py
```
